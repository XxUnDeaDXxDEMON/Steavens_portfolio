    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My Name is Richard Andres Steavens I was born June 13th 1996. I have gone through grammar school as well as highschool. I have been a part time college student before going into the workforce starting out with customer service. First job I had was working with a huge demographic of races in a hookah lounge. From there I moved on to working in retail. After retail, which didn't last too long I started working in restaurants. That's where I found my love for helping others by giving them a service. I currently still work in a restaurant no longer behind a grill but as a server. Having this job taught me my communication skills along with time management. On my off time I enjoy playing video games which led me to build my current PC im typing this portfolio out on. I've always been knowledgeable about technology but took my knowledge to greater heights after starting a Coding Bootcamp Course with UC Berkeley. Through this class I have learned the skills to read and write codes such as HTML, CSS, and JAVAScript. I never knew the time and skill it took to create just a simple web page. Through my page I hope you find information about myself and my experience in coding. Thank you for reading about myself.
