    <p>
        My Name is Richard Andres Steavens I was born June 13th 1996. I have gone through grammer school as well as highschool. I have been a part time college student before going into the work force starting out with customer service. First job i had was working with a huge demographic of races in a hookah lounge. From there I moved on to working in retail. After retail, whcih didnt last to long I started working in resturants. Thats where i found my love for helping others by giving them a service. I currenlty still work in a restaunt no longer behind a grill but as a server. Having this job taught me my communication sklills along with time managment. On my off time i enjoy playing video games:whcih led me to build my currently PC im typing this portfolio out on. Ive always been knowledgeable about technolgy but took my knowledge to greater hieghts after starting a Coding Bootcamp Course with UC Berkley. Through this class i have learned the skills to read and write codes such as HTML, CSS, and JAVA Script. I never knew the time and skill it took to create just a simple web page. Through my page I hope you find enjoy information about my self and my experence in coding. Thank you for reading about my self.
